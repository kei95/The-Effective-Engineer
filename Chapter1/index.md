# Chapter 1 - Adopt Right Mindsets

## **1. Use Leverage as Your Yardstick for Effectiveness**

- Leverage = Impact (or) value produced /  Time Invested.
    - Means that it’s the return on the investment(ROI) for the effort that’s put in.

### **“In a single year, a typical engineer works between 1,880 and 2,820 hours.”**

So even devoting 1 hour everyday for 1 month(20 hours) is only 1% of year time. However, if what’s done towards this time is right ting(it is mentor/on-boding in an example), the it’d payout greatly. That’s defined as “high-leverage” action

<br />

## **2. Increase Leverage in Three Ways**

Your overall leverage - the amount of value you can produce per unit time - can only be increased in three ways:

1. By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity.
2. By increasing the output of a particular activity.
3. By shifting to higher-leverage activities.

So questions to be asked to yourself are:

1. How can I complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?
2. How can I increase the value produced by this activity?
3. Is there something else that I could spend my time on that would produce more value?

It’s important to ask these three questions to yourself all the time to increase your ***leverage***.

<br />

## **3. Direct Energy Toward Leverage Points, Not Just Easy Wins**

Piling up easy wins doesn’t mean making lots of leverage. You need to invest your time, which is the most limited resource on right thing to increase your(team)’s leverage. That beats the leverage you’d make with easy wins or low hanging fruits

<br />

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Use leverage to measure your engineering effectiveness.**
    - Focus on what generates the highest return on investment for your time spent.
- **Systematically increase the leverage of your time.**
    - Find ways to get an activity done more quickly, to increase the impact of an activity, or to shift to activities with higher leverage.
- **Focus your effort on leverage points.**
    - Time is your most limited asset. Identify the habits that produce disproportionately high impact for the time you invest.
