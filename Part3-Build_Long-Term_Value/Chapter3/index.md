# Chapter 3 - Invest in Your Team’s Growth

“I traced through code littered with obscure variable names like `qqq` and questionable function names like `load2` and `load3`”

One of the biggest lessons I learned from Ooyala is - ***Investing in a positive, smooth onboarding experience is extremely valuable.***

- Investing in onboarding is just one way to invest in your team’s growth.

*The people and the team that you work with have a significant impact on your own effectiveness.*

*And you don’t have to be a manager or a senior engineer to influence your team’s direction.*

- Building a solid team is also a job for developers

***The higher you climb up the engineering ladder, the more your effectiveness will be measured not by your individual contributions but by your impact on the people around you.***

- Your career success depends largely on your company and team’s success, and the success of your company or team depends on more than just your individual contributions.

## 1. Make Hiring Everyone’s Responsibility

Core part of the problem of hiring is often that engineers simply aren’t spending enough time on hiring.

A good interview process achieves two goals.

1. it screens for the type of people likely to do well on the team
2. It gets candidates excited about the team, the mission, and the culture.
    1. Ideally, even if a candidate goes home without an offer, they still leave with a good impression of the team and refer their friends to interview with the company.
- Interviews should be fun and rigorous.

As an interviewer, your goal is to optimize for questions with high *signal-to-noise* rations

- questions that reveal a large amount of useful information(signal) about the candidate per minute spent, with little irrelevant or useless data(noise).

In order to keep the quality of interviews updated, here are a few higher-leverage strategies to keep in mind:

- Take time with your team to identify which qualities in a potential teammate you care about the most
    - programming, communication skills, culture fit, or something else... Coordinate to ensure that all the key areas get covered during an interview loop
- Design interview problems with multiple layers of difficulty that you can tailor to the candidate’s ability by adding or removing variables and constraints
- Control the interview pace to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio. Don’t let interviewees ramble, get stumped, or get sidetracked for too long.
    - Either guide the interviewee along with hints, or wrap up and move on to a different question.
- Scan for red flags by rapidly firing short-answer questions to probe a wide surface area.
    - Questions like how parameter passing works in a programming language or how a core library works might take a qualified candidate no more than a few seconds or a minute to answer, but can surface any warning areas that you might want to further address.
- Periodically shadow or pair with another team member during interviews. These sessions help calibrate ratings across interviewers and provide opportunities to give each other feedback on improving the interview process
- Don’t be afraid to use unconventional interview approaches if they help you identify the signals that your team cares about.

As with all skills, the only way that you can become more effective in interviewing and hiring is through iteration and practice. It’s worth for the effort.

The additional output from adding a strong engineer to your team far exceeds the output of many other investments that you could have.
