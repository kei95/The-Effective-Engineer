# Chapter 2 - Optimize for Learning

## 1. Adapt a Growth Mindset

Edmond suggests that there are two kinds of mindset of self-perceptions and beliefs. “***Fixed mindset*”** and “***Growth mindset***”. These mindset, where personality comes from, changes behavior as a result.

- **Carol Dweck** - The author of [Mindset](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B000FCKPHG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
    - She found that people adopt one of two mindsets, which in turn affects how they view effort and time.
    - ***Fixed mindset***  - “human qualities are carved in stone”
        - Failure indicates you are not smart
        - Tend to give up early and easily
    - ***Growth mindset*** - “human cultivate and grow their intelligence and skills through effort”
        - Failures are opportunities to learn
        - Tend to much less likely to give up on their paths to success
        

### “It’s not about apologizing for where your resume doesn’t line up but rather telling *your* story - who you are, what skills you’ve built, what you’re excited about doing next and why ”

Writing her own story instead of letting others define it, she ended up leading the distributed data systems team at one of Silicon Valley’s hottest companies, which went public in January 2015.

Giving up on expanding your control and making an excuse with things you “can’t” make it control, is a failure mindset.

## 2. Invest in Your Rate of Learning

Leaning is similar to investment. You skill and knowledge compounds like interest. Thus the earlier you start, the sooner you hit the region of “rapid growth” and the faster you can reap your benefits. It’s almost the same as financial advice to start as soon as you can. Even a single % everyday can adds up to massive number in few years. So continue is the key.

## 3. Seek Work environments Conductive to Learning

Since we spend most of our day at work, one of the biggest leverage point for increasing our learning rate is our choice of work environment.

It’s natural that you’ll have some learning period at the beginning. However, beyond that point, an ideal work place should remain where you can sustainably learn new things day after day.

The followings are the six major factors to consider when choosing a new job or team and questions you should be asking for each of them:

### 1. **Fast growth**

When the business or the product grows fast, it makes it easier to attract strong talent and build a strong team, which feeds back to generate even more growth.

And lack of growth leads to stagnation and politics.

**Questions to consider**

- What’s the monthly growth rates of core business metrics?
- Are the particular initiatives that you’d be working on high priorities, which sufficient support and resources form the company to grow?
- How aggressively has the company or team been hiring in the past year?
- How quickly have the strongest team members grown into positions of leadership?

### 2. **Training**

Strong onboarding programs demonstrate that the organization prioritizes new employees.

A solid mentorship program indicates that the team prioritizes professional growth.

 **Questions to consider**

- Is each new person expected to figure things out on his or her own, or is there a more formalized way of onboarding new engineers?
- Is there formal or informal mentorship?
- What steps has the company taken to ensure that team members continue to learn and grow?

### 3. **Openness**

Open-minded organization stands a much better chance of success. That’s more likely to happen if employees challenge each others’ decisions and incorporate feedback into the feature iterations.

An ideal team is like Reflecting on failed projects, understanding what caused production outages, and reviewing the returns on different product investments all help the right lessons get internalized. 

 **Questions to consider**

- Do employees know what priorities difference teams are working on?
- Do teams meet to reflect on whether product changes and feature launches were worth the effort?
- How is knowledge documented and shared across the company?
- What are examples of lessons that the team has learned?

### 4. **Pace**

A work environment that iterates quickly provides a faster feedback cycle and enables you to learn at a faster rate. For your personal growth, it’s an ideal to be in a fast-feed back cycle environment.

 **Questions to consider**

- Is moving quickly reflected in the company or engineering values?
- What tools does the team se to increase iteration speed?
- What percentage of time is spent on maintenance versus developing new products and features?

### 5. **People**

Surrounding yourself with people who are smarter, more talented, and more creative than you means surrounding yourself with potential teachers and mentors.

 **Questions to consider**

- Do the people who interviewed you seem smarter than you?
- Are these skills they can teach you?
- Would you want to work with the people you interviewed with?
- Do people tend to work on one-person projects, or are teamwork and cooperation common themes?

### 6. **Autonomy**

The freedom to choose what to work on and how to do it drives our ability to learn —— as long as we have the support that we need to use that freedom effectively.

 **Questions to consider**

- Do people have the autonomy to choose what projects they work on and how they do them?
- How often do individuals switch teams or projects?
- What breath of the codebase can an individual expect to work on over  the course of a year?
- Do engineers participate in discussions on product design and influence product direction?

### **Conclusion**

Theses six factors vary from company to company and from team to team, and their importance to you will also changes during the course of your career.

For example, onboarding and mentoring are more important for earlier of your career while autonomy matter more later on.

## 5. Always be learning 

Leaning opportunities aren't limited to the workplace. Always ask yourself;
- How can I improve?
- How could I have done this better?
- What should I learn next to nest prepare me for the future?
Even though your personal life or hobbies improvement might not be translate directly into engineering benefits, the practice of adopting a growth mind set toward them still makes you better learners. ***This itself is a high-leverage investment***
Continual leaning is inextricably linked with increased happiness.

**Ten starting points to help inspire a habit of learning outside of the workplace**

- **Lean new programming languages and frameworks**
  - Leaning new skills can expand your mind and teach you how to think in different ways.
- **Invest in skills that are in high demand**
  - Evaluate the current industry trends and demand for skills, so that you can see the "trendy" skills that you need to know. It helps you to catch up to the industry's standard.
- **Read books**
  - Books offer a way for you to learn from the lessons and mistakes of others.
  - Means that you can re-apply that knowledge without having to start from scratch.
  - This is such a high leverage investment.
- **Join discussion group**
  - Having a different perspective on a book helps you to expand your way to thinking.
- **Attend talks, conferences, and meetups**
  - It can be *hit-or-miss* in terms of quality, so ask around to see which ones are worth attending.
- **Build and maintain a strong network of relationships**
  - The more people you know, the more you'll find serendipitous opportunities.
  - Richard Wiseman in **The Luck Factor** that "Lucky people dramatically increase the possibility of a lucky chance encounter by meeting a large number  of people in their daily lives.The more people they meet, the greater opportunity they have of running into someone who could have a positive effect on their lives."  
- **Follow bloggers who teach**
  - Bloggers can give you some great information for your career and skill, good to follow good ones

- **Write to teach**
  - Leaning by teaching is the technique of Physics Nobel Prize winner ***Richard Feynman***
  - Writing also provides an opportunity for mindful reflection on what you've learned

- **Tinker on side projects**
  - Research suggests that creativity stems from combining existing and often disparate ideas in new ways.

- **Pursue what you love**
  - Americans spend about 34 hours watching TV per week, and average mood while watching TV highly is mildly depressed

Overall, what's important the most is embracing a growth mindset in which you're motivated to learn about the things that excite you.
By Adopting growth mindset and optimizing for leaning, you'll be best prepared to make the most of whatever opportunities do come your way.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Own your story**
    - Focus on changes that are within your sphere of influence rather than blaming the parts that you can't control.
    - View failures and challenges through a growth mindset, and see them as opportunities to learn.
- **Don't shortchange your learning rate**

    - Find out what opportunities they provide for onboarding and mentoring, how transparent they are internally, how fast they move, what your prospective co-workers are like, and how much autonomy you'll have.

- **Capitalize on opportunities at work to improve your technical skills**
  - Learn from your best co-workers. Study their code and their reviews.

- **Locate learning opportunities outside of the workplace**
  - Challenge yourself to become better by just 1% a day.
  - ALl learnings don't have to be related to engineering skills.
