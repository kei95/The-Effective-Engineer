# The-Effective-Engineer

## **Overview**

In this repository, I'll leave my thoughts and notes on each chapters of the book "[The Effective Engineer](http://www.effectiveengineer.com/)" to review back even after finishing reading the book.

The Effective Engineer is a book written by Edmond Lau. Who has worked for some top companies in Silicon Valley. 
The books is designed specifically for today's software engineers, based on extensive interviews with engineering leaders at top tech companies, and packed with hundreds of techniques to accelerate professional career.

## **Motivation**

I've been participating a book club held by [Wataru Oguchi](https://mobile.twitter.com/watarutwt) and the next book we are tackling on is this one.
It's always challenging work effectively in a real work environment(I know you know why). I hope to get some ideas and techniques to improve my effectiveness and values as a software developer.

## **Where is your book club?**

The book club is held every Wednesday on 8pm(PST) virtually. Feel free to reach out to [me](https://twitter.com/kei957) or the [host](https://mobile.twitter.com/watarutwt) if you are interested in joining our club. The more the merrier!
